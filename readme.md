## **Setup and Execution**  

### **Environment Variables**  
To connect to the database, configure the `.env` file with the following variables:  
```env
PORT=3000
DB_USER='postgres'
DB_PASSWORD='123456'
DB_HOST='localhost'
DB_NAME='notesdb'
DB_PORT='5432'
```  

### **Automated Setup with `start.sh`**  
This project includes three shell scripts (`.sh` files) to streamline setup and execution:  

1. **`start.sh`** â€“ The main script to handle all installation and configuration steps. It:  
   - Installs project dependencies for both backend and frontend.  
   - Sets up the environment.  
   - Starts the development servers.  

   To run this script:  
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```  

2. **Additional Scripts** â€“ The other two scripts are auxiliary tools (e.g., for cleaning the project or resetting configurations). You can explore their functionality as needed.  

---

### **Manual Setup (Optional)**  
If you prefer to configure the project manually, follow these steps:  

#### **Backend Setup**  
1. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
3. Run the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  

#### **Frontend Setup**  
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
3. Start the frontend server:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  
4. Open the application in your browser (default: `http://localhost:5173`).
